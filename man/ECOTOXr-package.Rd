\details{
The ECOTOXr provides the means to efficiently search, extract and analyse \href{https://www.epa.gov/}{US EPA}
\href{https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/}{ECOTOX} data, with a focus on reproducible results. Although the package
creator/maintainer is confident in the quality of this software, it is the end users sole responsibility to
assure the quality of his or her work while using this software. As per the provided license terms the package
maintainer is not liable for any damage resulting from its usage. That being said, below we present some tips
for generating reproducible results with this package.

\section{How do I get started?}{

Installing this package is only the first step to get things started. You need to perform the following steps
in order to use the package to its full capacity.
\itemize{
\item First download a copy of the complete EPA database. This can be done by calling \code{\link[=download_ecotox_data]{download_ecotox_data()}}.
This may not always work on all machines as R does not always accept the website SSL certificate from the EPA.
In those cases the zipped archive with the database files can be downloaded manually with a different (more
forgiving) browser. The files from the zip archive can be extracted to a location of choice. Alternatively,
the user could try to use \verb{[download_ecotox_data](ssl_verifypeer = 0L)} when the download URL is trusted.
\item Next, an SQLite database needs to be build from the downloaded files. This will be done automatically when
you used \code{\link[=download_ecotox_data]{download_ecotox_data()}} in the previous step. When you have manually downloaded the files
you can call \code{\link[=build_ecotox_sqlite]{build_ecotox_sqlite()}} to build the database locally.
\item When the previous steps have been performed successfully, you can now search the database by calling
\code{\link[=search_ecotox]{search_ecotox()}}. You can also use \code{\link[=dbConnectEcotox]{dbConnectEcotox()}} to open a connection to the
database. You can query the database using this connection and any of the methods provided from the
\link[DBI:DBI-package]{DBI} or \link[RSQLite:SQLite]{RSQLite} packages.

\section{How do I obtain reproducible results?}{

Each individual user is responsible for evaluating the reproducibility of his or her work. Although
this package offers instruments to achieve reproducibility, it is not guaranteed. In order to increase the
chances of generating reproducible results, one should adhere at least to the following rules:
\itemize{
\item Always use an official release from CRAN, and cite the version used in your analyses (\code{citation("ECOTOXr")}).
Different versions, may produce different end results (although we will strive for backward compatibility).
\item Make sure you are working with a clean (unaltered) version of the database. When in doubt, download and build
a fresh copy of the database (\code{\link[=download_ecotox_data]{download_ecotox_data()}}). Also cite the (release) version of the downloaded
database (\code{\link[=cite_ecotox]{cite_ecotox()}}), and the system operating system in which the local database was build
\code{\link[=get_ecotox_info]{get_ecotox_info()}}). Or, just make sure that you never modify the database (e.g., write data to it, delete
data from it, etc.)
\item In order to avoid platform dependencies it is advised to only include non-accented alpha-numerical characters in
search terms. See also \link{search_ecotox} and \link{build_ecotox_sqlite}.
\item When trying to reproduce database extractions from earlier database releases, filter out additions after
that specific release. This can be done by adding output fields 'tests.modified_date', 'tests.created_date' and
'tests.published_date' to your search and compare those with the release date of the database you are trying to
reproduce results from.

\section{Why isn't the database included in the package?}{

This package doesn't come bundled with a copy of the database which needs to be downloaded the first time the
package is used. Why is this? There are several reasons:
\itemize{
\item The database is maintained and updated by the \href{https://www.epa.gov/}{US EPA}. This process is and should be
outside the sphere of influence of the package maintainer.
\item Packages on CRAN are not allowed to contain large amounts of data. Publication on CRAN is key to control
the quality of this package and therefore outweighs the convenience of having the data bundled with the package.
\item The user has full control over the release version of the database that is being used.
}
}

\section{Why does this package promotes using a local copy of the ECOTOX database?}{

Although this package offers experimental features for searching on-line, there are several reasons why we
opted for creating a local copy:
\itemize{
\item The user would be restricted to the search options provided on the website (\href{https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/}{ECOTOX}).
\item The on-line database doesn't come with an API that would allow for convenient interface. This is why
features implemented in this package are experimental.
\item The user is not limited by an internet connection and its bandwidth.
\item Not all database fields, and only a limited number of records, can be retrieved from the on-line interface.
