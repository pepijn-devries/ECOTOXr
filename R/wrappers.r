#' Search and retrieve toxicity records from the database
#'
#' `r lifecycle::badge('stable')` Create (and execute) an SQL search query based on basic search terms and
#' options. This allows you to search the database, without having to understand SQL.
#'
#' The ECOTOX database is stored locally as an SQLite file, which can be queried with SQL. These functions
#' allow you to automatically generate an SQL query and send it to the database, without having to understand
#' SQL. The function `search_query_ecotox` generates and returns the SQL query (which can be edited by
#' hand if desired). You can also directly call `search_ecotox`, this will first generate the query,
#' send it to the database and retrieve the result.
#'
#'
#' Although the generated query is not optimized for speed, it should be able to process most common searches
#' within an acceptable time. The time required for retrieving data from a search query depends on the complexity
#' of the query, the size of the query and the speed of your machine. Most queries should be completed within
#' seconds (or several minutes at most) on modern machines. If your search require optimisation for speed,
#' you could try reordering the search fields. You can also edit the query generated with `search_query_ecotox`
#' by hand and retrieve it with [DBI::dbGetQuery()].
#'
#' Note that this package is actively maintained and this function may be revised in future versions.
#' In order to create reproducible results the user must: always work with an official release from
#' CRAN and document the package and database version that are used to generate specific results (see also
#' [cite_ecotox()]).
#' @param search A named `list` containing the search terms. The names of the elements should refer to
#' the field (i.e. table header) in which the terms are searched. Use [list_ecotox_fields()] to
#' obtain a list of available field names.
#'
#' Each element in that list should contain another list with at least one element named 'terms'. This should
#' contain a `vector` of `character` strings with search terms. Optionally, a second element
#' named 'method' can be provided which should be set to either '`contains`' (default, when missing) or
#' '`exact`'. In the first case the query will match any record in the indicated field that contains
#' the search term. In case of '`exact`' it will only return exact matches. Note that searches are
#' not case sensitive, but are picky with special (accented) characters. While building the local database
#' (see [build_ecotox_sqlite]) such special characters may be treated differently on different
#' operating systems. For the sake of reproducibility, the user is advised to stick with non-accented
#' alpha-numeric characters.
#'
#' Search terms for a specific field (table header) will be combined with 'or'. Meaning that any record that
#' matches any of the terms are returned. For instance when 'latin_name' 'Daphnia magna' and 'Skeletonema costatum'
#' are searched, results for both species are returned. Search terms across fields (table headers) are combined with
#' 'and', which will narrow the search. For instance if 'chemical_name' 'benzene' is searched in combination
#' with 'latin_name' 'Daphnia magna', only tests where Daphnia magna are exposed to benzene are returned.
#'
#' When this search behaviour described above is not desirable, the user can either adjust the query manually,
#' or use this function to perform several separate searches and combine the results afterwards.
#'
#' Beware that some field names are ambiguous and occur in multiple tables (like `cas_number' and `code').
#' When searching such fields, the search result may not be as expected.
#' @param output_fields A `vector` of `character` strings indicating which field names (table headers)
#' should be included in the output. By default `[list_ecotox_fields]("default")` is used. Use
#' `[list_ecotox_fields]("all")` to list all available fields.
#' @param group_by_results
#' Ecological test results are generally the most informative element in the ECOTOX
#' database. Therefore, this search function returns a table with unique results in each row.
#'
#' However, some tables in the database (such as 'chemical_carriers' and 'dose_responses') have a one to many
#' relationship with test results. This means that multiple chemical carriers can be linked to a single test result,
#' similarly, multiple doses can also be linked to a single test result.
#'
#' By default the search results are grouped by test results. As a result not all doses or chemical carriers may
#' be displayed in the output. Set the `group_by_results` parameter to `FALSE` in order to force SQLite
#' to output all data (e.g., all carriers). But beware that test results may be duplicated in those cases.
#' @param compute The ECOTOXr package tries to construct database queries as lazy as possible. Meaning that R
#' moves as much of the heavy lifting as possible to the database. When your search becomes complicated (e.g., when
#' including many output fields), you may run into trouble and hit the SQL parser limits. In those cases you can set
#' this parameter to `TRUE`. Database queries are then computed in the process of joining tables. This is generally
#' slower. Alternatively, you could try to include less output fields in order to simplify the query.
#' @param as_data_frame `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')` `logical` value indicating whether the result should be
#' converted into a `data.frame` (default is `TRUE`). When set to `FALSE` the data will be returned as a [`tbl_df()`][dplyr::tibble].
#' @param ... Arguments passed to [dbConnectEcotox()] and other functions. You can use this when the database
#' is not located at the default path ([get_ecotox_path()]).
#' @returns In case of `search_query_ecotox`, a `character` string containing an SQL
#' query is returned. This query is built based on the provided search terms and options.
#'
#' In case of `search_ecotox` a `data.frame` is returned based on the search query built with
#' `search_query_ecotox`. The `data.frame` is unmodified as returned by SQLite, meaning that all
#' fields are returned as `character`s (even where the field types are 'date' or 'numeric').
#' Therefore, retrieved search results may need some post-processing with `process_ecotox_numerics()`
#' `as_numeric_ecotox()`
#'
#' The results are tagged with: a time stamp; the package version used; and the
#' file path of the SQLite database used in the search (when applicable). These tags are added as attributes
#' to the output table or query.
