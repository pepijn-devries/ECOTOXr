## Overview

<a href="https://github.com/pepijn-devries/ECOTOXr/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" alt="ECOTOXr logo" align="right" /></a>
`{ECOTOXr}` can be used to explore and analyse data from the [US EPA ECOTOX database](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/).
More specifically you can:

 * Build a local SQLite copy of the [US EPA ECOTOX database](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/)
 * Search and extract data from the local database
 * Use experimental features to search the on-line dashboards: [ECOTOX](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/search.cfm) and
   [CompTox](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/batch-search)

## Why use `{ECOTOXr}`?

The `{ECOTOXr}` package allows you to search and extract data from the [ECOTOXicological Knowledgebase](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/)
and import it directly into `R`. This will allow you to formalize and document the search- and extract-procedures in `R` code.
This makes it easier to share and reproduce such procedures and its results. Moreover, you can directly apply any statistical
analysis offered in `R`.

## Installation 

> Get CRAN version
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ECOTOXr")
```

> Get development version on github
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('pepijn-devries/ECOTOXr')
```

## Usage

### Preparing the database

Although `{ECOTOXr}` has experimental features to search the on-line database. The package will
reach its full potential when you build a copy of the database on your local machine.

> Download and build a local copy of the latest ASCII export of the US EPA ECOTOX database

```{r eval=FALSE}
download_ecotox_data()
```

### Searching the local database for species and substances

Obviously, searching the local database is only possible after the download and build is
ready (see previous section).

> Search the local database for tests of water flea Daphnia magna exposed to benzene

```{r eval=FALSE}
search_ecotox(
  list(
    latin_name    = list(terms = "Daphnia magna", method = "exact"),
    chemical_name = list(terms = "benzene",       method = "exact")
  )
)
```

### Three ways of querying the local database

Let's have a look at 3 different approaches for retrieving a specific record from the local database, using the
unique identifier `result_id`. The first option is to use the build in `search_ecotox` function. It uses
simple `R` syntax and allows you to search and collect any field from any table in the database. Furthermore,
all requested output fields are automatically joined to the result without the end-user needing to know anything
about the database structure.

> Using the prefab function `search_ecotox` packaged by `{ECOTOXr}`

```{r warning = FALSE}
search_ecotox(
  list(
    result_id = list(terms = "401386", method = "exact")
  ),
  as_data_frame = F
)
```

If you like to use [`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) verbs, you are in luck. SQLite database can be approached using
`{dplyr}` verbs. This approach will only return information from the `results` table. The end-user will have to join other information
(like test species and test substance) manually. This does require knowledge of the database structure.

> Using `{dplyr}` verbs

```{r warning = FALSE}
con <- dbConnectEcotox()
dplyr::tbl(con, "results") %>%
  dplyr::filter(result_id == "401386") %>%
  dplyr::collect()
```

If you prefer working using `SQL` directly, that is fine too. The [`{RSQLite}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RSQLite) package
allows you to get queries using `SQL` statements. The result is identical to that of the previous approach. Here too the end-user
needs knowledge of the database structure in order to join additional data.

> Using `SQL` syntax

```{r warning = FALSE}
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM results WHERE result_id='401386'") %>%
  dplyr::as_tibble()
```

## Disclaimers

It is the end-users own responsibility to check the quality of collected data, using the original referenced source in order to evaluate its
fitness for use, see also: <https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/help.cfm#info-limitations>.

Note that the package maintainer is not affiliated with the US EPA, this package is therefore **not** official US EPA software.
